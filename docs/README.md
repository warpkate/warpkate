# WarpKate

## Project Overview

WarpKate is an innovative open-source project aimed at integrating Warp Terminal's advanced features directly into the Kate text editor. This integration seeks to combine Kate's streamlined editing capabilities with Warp's modern terminal features, creating a seamless development environment.

The project takes an unconventional approach to open source development, with AI assistance playing a significant role in project architecture, specification, and guidance, while human developers contribute implementation expertise in C++ and Qt.

### Core Features

- Implementation of Warp's terminal protocol within Kate
- Block-based command execution model
- Advanced syntax highlighting for terminal output
- AI-powered command suggestions
- Seamless integration with Kate's editor interface

## Project Goals

1. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Create a unified environment where editing and terminal operations coexist seamlessly
2. **Terminal Innovation**: Bring modern terminal features from Warp into the KDE ecosystem
3. **AI Integration**: Leverage AI capabilities for command suggestions and assistance
4. **Open Source Collaboration**: Pioneer a new model of AI-assisted open source development
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure functionality across Linux, and potentially macOS
