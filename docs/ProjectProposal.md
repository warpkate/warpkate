# WarpKate Project Proposal

## Project Overview

**WarpKate** is an innovative open-source project that aims to integrate the modern features of Warp Terminal into Kate, KDE's powerful text editor. This integration will bring Warp's AI-assisted command suggestions, block-based command execution model, and enhanced terminal experience directly into the Kate editor, creating a seamless development environment.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a next-generation terminal experience within the Kate editor that enhances developer productivity through AI assistance while maintaining the lightweight and efficient nature of Kate. WarpKate will bridge the gap between traditional terminal usage and modern AI-assisted development, all within KDE's robust and user-friendly ecosystem.

By implementing Warp Terminal's protocol directly in Kate, we aim to create not just a terminal plugin, but a complete development environment that understands commands, provides contextual suggestions, and organizes terminal output in a more accessible way.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Implement Warp's Terminal Protocol in Kate**
   - Create a native implementation of Warp's terminal protocol
   - Support block-based command execution and output organization
   - Maintain compatibility with standard terminal applications

2. **Integrate AI-Assisted Features**
   - Implement command suggestions based on context
   - Provide intelligent command completion
   - Offer documentation and examples inline

3. **Enhance Developer Experience**
   - Create seamless navigation between editor and terminal
   - Enable context-aware interactions between code and terminal
   - Improve readability of terminal output with syntax highlighting

4. **Maintain KDE Integration**
   - Follow KDE's design guidelines and integration patterns
   - Support system-wide KDE themes and configurations
   - Ensure compatibility with Kate's plugin ecosystem

5. **Pioneer a New Development Model**
   - Establish a collaborative framework with AI assistance
   - Create documentation and processes that enable community contribution
   - Build a sustainable development process that leverages both human and AI capabilities

## Implementation Approach

### Technical Architecture

The WarpKate plugin will be structured in several layers:

1. **Core Terminal Emulation Layer**
   - Implementation of VT100/ANSI terminal protocols
   - Process management and I/O handling
   - Terminal state management

2. **Warp Protocol Layer**
   - Block-based command execution model
   - Output parsing and organization
   - History and navigation features

3. **AI Integration Layer**
   - Command suggestion engine
   - Context-aware completions
   - Documentation integration

4. **UI Layer**
   - Terminal widget integration with Kate
   - Block visualization and interaction
   - Suggestion display and interaction components

### Development Phases

The project will be developed in incremental phases:
