# WarpKate Troubleshooting Session Summary

## Project Context
- WarpKate is a Kate text editor plugin that integrates Warp Terminal features
- Source directory: `/home/yani/Projects/WarpKate`
- Plugin files are installed to: `/usr/lib64/qt6/plugins/kf6/ktexteditor/`

## Key Issues Investigated

### 1. Plugin Not Loading Issue
- Plugin was working on one machine (marie) but not on another (maud)
- Created a diagnostic script to gather comprehensive system information from both machines
- Compared configurations, permissions, and dependencies between the systems

### 2. System Comparison Findings
- Both systems: Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition), Kate 25.04.0
- Key differences discovered:
  - Marie (working): Plugin files had 644 permissions (`-rwxr--r--`)
  - Maud (non-working): Plugin files had 755 permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`)
  - Marie did not have kf6-kio package installed, while maud did
  - Marie had a more established Kate configuration

## Solution Found
- **Root cause**: Two versions of Kate were installed on maud
  - System version (rpm package)
  - Flatpak version
- **Problem**: The Flatpak version couldn't access the system-installed plugin due to sandboxing
- **Fix**: Removed the Flatpak version of Kate, using only the system package version

## Technical Insights
1. **Flatpak sandboxing**:
   - Flatpak applications run in isolated environments with limited access to system directories
   - System-installed plugins (`/usr/lib64/...`) are not accessible to Flatpak applications by default
   - Different Qt/KDE versions between Flatpak and system packages can cause compatibility issues

2. **Plugin requirements**:
   - For system-installed Kate, plugins should be installed to system directories
   - For Flatpak Kate, plugins should be packaged as Flatpak extensions

3. **Permission quirks**:
   - Contrary to initial expectations, the more restrictive permissions (644) on the working system
   - This might be related to how KDE loads plugins (doesn't need execute bit on .so files)

## Future Work
1. **Plugin installation options**:
   - Create proper installation packages (RPM/DEB)
   - Consider creating a Flatpak extension version for Flatpak Kate users

2. **Development environment setup**:
   - Document development setup to avoid mismatched Kate versions
   - Add version checks to detect incompatible environments

3. **Build process improvements**:
   - Ensure JSON files are properly copied to build directories
   - Set appropriate file permissions during installation

4. **Testing framework**:
   - Create automated tests that verify plugin loads correctly
   - Test with both system and Flatpak versions of Kate

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update installation docs to mention potential Flatpak issues
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common issues

## Diagnostic Resources
- Created a diagnostic script (`diagnostic_script.sh`) that generates detailed system information
- Output file: `warpkate_system_check.txt`
- Script can be used to diagnose similar issues on other systems

---

This troubleshooting session resolved the plugin loading issue by identifying the incompatibility between system-installed plugins and Flatpak applications. Future work should focus on improving the installation process, creating appropriate packaging for different distribution methods, and enhancing documentation.
