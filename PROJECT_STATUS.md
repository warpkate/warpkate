# WarpKate Project Status

*Last Updated: May 10, 2025*

## Project Introduction

WarpKate is an innovative open-source project that integrates Warp Terminal's advanced features directly into the Kate text editor. The project aims to create a seamless development environment by combining Kate's powerful editing capabilities with Warp's modern terminal features, including block-based command execution, enhanced output formatting, and AI-assisted suggestions.

What makes this project unique is its development approach: WarpKate is being designed and guided by AI, with human developers contributing implementation expertise. This represents a novel experiment in AI-assisted open source development, potentially establishing new workflows for collaborative software creation.

## Work Completed

### Documentation
- **Project Proposal**: Comprehensive document outlining the vision, goals, and implementation approach
- **Technical Specification**: Detailed architecture and design specification, including component breakdowns, APIs, and data models
- **README**: Project overview, installation instructions, and contribution guidelines
- **Contributing Guide**: Detailed guide for potential contributors
- **Code of Conduct**: Adoption of KDE Community standards

### Repository Setup
- Initialized Git repository with proper structure
- Created CMake build system configuration
- Added standard project metadata files (.gitignore, LICENSE, etc.)
- Organized directory structure for source code, documentation, and resources

### Code Structure
- Implemented plugin architecture following KDE/Kate plugin standards
- Created basic view and plugin classes (WarpKatePlugin, WarpKateView)
- Designed initial UI layouts for terminal widget and configuration
- Added placeholder implementations for terminal functionality
- Set up action handling for terminal operations
- Created resource files and UI definitions

## Current Status

The project is currently in the initial development phase. The basic plugin structure is in place, providing a foundation for the terminal integration features. The documentation is comprehensive, offering a clear roadmap for implementation.

Key components that have been scaffolded:
- Plugin integration with Kate
- UI framework for terminal display
- Action system for terminal operations
- Configuration interface

The project is ready for:
- Implementation of the terminal emulation functionality
- Development of the block-based command model
- Integration of AI suggestion capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Terminal Emulation Implementation**:
   - Create the VT100/ANSI terminal emulator class
   - Implement PTY (pseudo-terminal) handling
   - Add basic input/output processing

2. **Block Model Development**:
   - Implement the command block data structure
   - Create UI components for block display
   - Add block navigation functionality

3. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Configure CI/CD for automated testing
   - Create initial release pipeline

### Medium-term Goals
1. **AI Integration**:
   - Develop context awareness system
   - Implement suggestion generation framework
   - Create UI for displaying and selecting suggestions

2. **Advanced Terminal Features**:
   - Add syntax highlighting for command output
   - Implement command history management
   - Add themability and customization options

3. **Community Building**:
   - Engage with KDE community for feedback
   - Document APIs for third-party extensions
   - Create examples and tutorials
