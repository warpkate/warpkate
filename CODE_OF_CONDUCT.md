# Code of Conduct

## WarpKate Community Code of Conduct

The WarpKate project adheres to the [KDE Community Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/).

### Summary of the KDE Code of Conduct

The KDE Community is dedicated to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

Key principles include:

- **Be respectful and considerate**: Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks.
- **Be inclusive**: Welcome and support newcomers and those unfamiliar with our project.
- **Be collaborative**: Working together helps improve the experience for all users.
- **Be empathetic**: Perceive other people's viewpoint with charity and compassion.
- **Be mindful of language**: Use inclusive language and avoid unwelcome sexual attention or imagery.
- **Take responsibility**: When issues arise, take responsibility for our words and actions.
- **Ask for help**: Reach out to the community leadership if you need assistance.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting the project team or KDE's Community Working Group at [conduct@kde.org](mailto:conduct@kde.org).

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [KDE Community Code of Conduct](https://kde.org/code-of-conduct/), which itself builds upon established codes of conduct including the Contributor Covenant and the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.
