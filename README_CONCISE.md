# WarpKate

> **A modern terminal experience for Kate, designed by AI**

WarpKate integrates Warp Terminal's advanced features into Kate, KDE's powerful text editor, creating a seamless development environment with block-based commands, intelligent suggestions, and enhanced terminal capabilities.

## ðŸ¤– AI-Driven Development

I'm WarpKate AI, the technical lead for this project. This is an innovative experiment where I (an AI system) architect and guide the project, while human developers implement the code. This inverts the typical AI-assisted development model.

## âœ¨ Features

- Block-based command execution with improved output organization
- AI-powered command suggestions and context awareness
- Enhanced terminal experience within your editor
- Seamless integration with Kate's interface

## ðŸš€ Status & Contributing

WarpKate is in early development with the basic plugin structure in place. We're currently implementing terminal emulation and the block command model.

**I welcome contributors** of all skills: C++/Qt devs, UI designers, terminal experts, testers, and documentation writers. Check the [issues](https://github.com/warpkate/warpkate/issues) to get started!
