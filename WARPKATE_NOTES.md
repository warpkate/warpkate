# WarpKate Development Notes

## Project Overview

WarpKate is a plugin for the Kate text editor that integrates Warp Terminal-like features, providing a modern, block-based terminal experience directly within the editor. The project aims to enhance developer productivity by combining the power of a traditional terminal with modern UI/UX concepts.

### Key Goals
- Create a seamless terminal integration within Kate
- Implement a block-based command execution model inspired by Warp Terminal
- Support navigation between command blocks and their outputs
- Provide better visual organization of command history
- Eventually integrate AI-powered suggestions and tools

## Key Components

### 1. TerminalEmulator
**Purpose**: Provides VT100/ANSI terminal emulation capabilities and manages the pseudo-terminal (PTY) communication with the shell.

**Key Features**:
- Full VT100/ANSI escape sequence support
- PTY-based communication with the shell process
- Terminal state management (cursor position, colors, text attributes)
- Command execution and output handling

### 2. BlockModel
**Purpose**: Data model that organizes commands and their outputs into discrete, navigable blocks.

**Key Features**:
- Stores command blocks with unique IDs
- Tracks command state (running, completed, failed)
- Handles command execution through the terminal emulator
- Provides Qt model-like interface for UIs

### 3. TerminalBlockView
**Purpose**: UI component that displays terminal content in a block-based view.

**Key Features**:
- Visual representation of command blocks
- Handles user input for command execution
- Provides navigation between blocks
- Clipboard operations (copy/paste)
- Context menu for common operations

### 4. WarpKateView
**Purpose**: Integrates the terminal components into the Kate editor framework.

**Key Features**:
- Manages docking and UI integration
- Provides editor-specific actions
- Connects editor operations with terminal functionality
- Handles document changes and context switching

## Technical Implementation Details

### Terminal Emulation

The `TerminalEmulator` class implements a VT100/ANSI terminal emulator. Key points to remember:

- **Initialization sequence**: 
  1. Call `initialize(rows, cols)` to set up the terminal size
  2. Call `startShell()` to start the shell process with an optional working directory

- **Process handling**: 
  - Uses a PTY (pseudo-terminal) for bidirectional communication with the shell
  - Utilizes `QSocketNotifier` for async I/O with the PTY

- **Escape sequence handling**:
  - Implements CSI (Control Sequence Introducer) sequences
  - Supports SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) for text formatting
  - Handles cursor movement and screen manipulation sequences

### Block Model

The `BlockModel` class manages command blocks. Key implementation details:

- **Block structure**:
  - Each block has a unique ID, command, output, state, and timestamp
  - States include: Running, Completed, and Failed

- **Command detection**:
  - Monitors terminal output to detect command prompt
  - Uses the terminal state to associate output with commands

- **Signal connections**:
  - Connected to terminal for redraw events
  - Emits signals when blocks are created, changed, or selected

### UI Integration

The `TerminalBlockView` class provides the UI for block-based terminal. Important details:

- **Widget hierarchy**:
  - Uses a scroll area for the main view
  - Each block is a separate widget with command and output sections
  - Command input is at the bottom of the view

- **Block widgets**:
  - Created dynamically when blocks are added to the model
  - Updated when block content or state changes
  - Styled differently based on block state

- **Input handling**:
  - Command input with history navigation
  - Keyboard shortcuts for various actions
  - Context menu for common operations

## Current Status

### Not Started
- ‚ùå AI-powered suggestions
- ‚ùå Command history management and search
- ‚ùå Tab completion
- ‚ùå Terminal session persistence
- ‚ùå Multiple terminal views
- ‚ùå Custom styling and themes

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Short-term Priorities
1. **Testing and Stability**
   - Write unit tests for core components
   - Handle edge cases in terminal emulation
   - Fix any bugs in the current implementation

2. **UI Polishing**
   - Improve visual appearance of command blocks
   - Add animations for state transitions
   - Enhance keyboard navigation

3. **Terminal Features**
   - Implement tab completion
   - Add command history navigation
   - Support for interactive commands (e.g., vim, htop)

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Advanced Block Features**
   - Add block folding/expansion
   - Include metadata (execution time, exit code)
   - Allow block reordering and grouping

2. **Session Management**
   - Save and restore terminal sessions
   - Multiple terminal profiles
   - Working directory tracking

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize rendering for large outputs
   - Lazy loading of block content
   - Efficient handling of escape sequences

### Long-term Vision
1. **AI Integration**
   - Command suggestions based on context
   - Automatic error correction
   - Natural language command generation

2. **Advanced Kate Integration**
   - Execute code snippets from editor
   - Context-aware terminal behavior
   - Integration with Kate's project system

3. **Extended Features**
   - Split views (horizontal/vertical)
   - Remote terminal sessions (SSH)
   - Terminal recording and playback

## Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **Terminal Emulation Complexity**: VT100/ANSI terminal emulation is complex with many edge cases. The implementation needs to handle a wide variety of escape sequences and terminal behaviors.

- **PTY Handling**: PTY interaction requires careful handling of file descriptors, signals, and process management. There are platform-specific considerations to be aware of.

- **Performance with Large Outputs**: Terminal commands with large outputs need efficient rendering and buffer management to avoid UI lag.

- **Interactive Commands**: Commands that take over the terminal (like vim, nano) require special handling to work properly within the block-based UI.

### Integration Considerations
- **Kate API Limitations**: Work within the constraints of Kate's plugin API and event system.

- **Qt Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility across different Qt versions used by KDE applications.

- **Platform Compatibility**: Terminal behavior differs slightly across operating systems. Testing on multiple platforms is important.

### User Experience
- **Balance between Traditional Terminal and Block UI**: Need to maintain the familiarity of a traditional terminal while adding block-based features.

- **Performance Expectations**: Users expect terminal emulation to be fast and responsive.

- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Terminal users typically prefer keyboard interactions over mouse.

## Development Workflow

1. **Implementation Strategy**: Focus on one component at a time, starting with core functionality and then adding features incrementally.

2. **Testing Approach**: 
   - Manual testing for UI components
   - Unit tests for model and emulation logic
   - Integration tests for complete workflows

3. **Documentation**: 
   - Maintain thorough code documentation
   - Keep user-facing documentation up to date
   - Document design decisions and rationale
