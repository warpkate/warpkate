# WarpKate v0.15 Release Notes

*Release Date: May 13, 2025*

We're excited to announce the release of WarpKate v0.15, which introduces significant usability improvements including clickable file paths in terminal output and a fix for mode switching behavior. This release enhances the integration between terminal operations and file management, offering a more seamless workflow for Kate users.

## New Features

### Clickable File Paths in Terminal Output ðŸ”—

- **Terminal Links**: Files and directories in terminal output are now automatically detected and converted to clickable links
- **Context Menus**: Right-click on any file or directory path to access context-specific actions
- **Smart Actions**:
  - Directories open in file manager or change the current working directory
  - Text files open in Kate editor
  - Other file types open with their default applications
  - Executable files can be run directly from the terminal output
- **Visual Indicators**: Directories are displayed in bold for easier identification

### Enhanced Mode Switching with '>' Character

- **Bidirectional Toggle**: The '>' character now properly toggles between Terminal and AI modes in both directions
- **Improved User Experience**: Typing '>' at the beginning of an empty input will:
  - Switch from Terminal mode to AI mode
  - Switch from AI mode back to Terminal mode
- **Consistent UI Updates**: Mode toggle buttons are properly synchronized when switching modes

## Improvements

- **File Type Detection**: Better detection of file types for more accurate default actions
- **Terminal Output Processing**: Improved processing of ANSI escape sequences and control characters
- **Conversation Area**: Now uses `QTextBrowser` for better link handling capabilities
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling for file operations

## Bug Fixes

- **Mode Toggle**: Fixed the '>' toggle to properly switch from AI mode back to Terminal mode
- **Terminal Output**: Fixed issues with terminal output processing that could lead to garbled text
- **Link Detection**: Improved accuracy of file path detection in various terminal output formats
